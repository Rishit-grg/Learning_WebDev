<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Rishit Garg — a curious learner, future engineer, and aspiring full-stack web developer from India. I’m currently preparing to start my first semester of engineering 
  and using this transition phase to level up my skills in mathematics and web development.</p>

<p>My academic journey has been shaped by a deep interest in mastering complex concepts, especially in subjects like calculus, where I’ve been dedicating time to build a strong
 foundation. I'm passionate about creating real-world applications using code and exploring how AI can be integrated into modern web development to build smarter, 
 more impactful tools.</p>
<p>Outside the screen, I enjoy diving deep into meaningful questions — from science and history to philosophy and technology.
 I don’t just want to build software; I want to build software that matters.</p>

<p>Thanks for visiting my site — I’m excited to share my journey, projects, and growth with you!</p>
