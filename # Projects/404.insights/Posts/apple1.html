    <h1>WWDC 25: Whatâ€™s new from Apple </h1>
    <img class="main-img" src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/NKSLnu7HK1bwlIMXaHGG3A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTY0MDtoPTQ1NQ--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/usa_today_tech_153/5fbd76022926f5237dce1ce72291c3c6" width="700" alt="APPLE WWDC25 event POSTER ">
    <p>At WWDC 2025, Apple unveiled significant updates across its platforms, introducing a new design language called Liquid Glass and a yearly naming scheme for its operating systems. iOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, tvOS 26, watchOS 26, and visionOS 26 all adopt the sleek, transparent aesthetic, adding a layer of visual refinement. Apple also expanded Apple Intelligence, allowing third-party developers to integrate AI-powered features, and embedded ChatGPT into Image Playground for enhanced image-based interactions. Additionally, a new Games app centralizes gaming experiences across Apple devices, improving connectivity with friends.</p>
    <p>Despite major AI advancements, Siri remained largely absent from Apple's keynote, raising concerns about its future. Apple executives acknowledged the delay in delivering a significantly upgraded Siri, citing reliability issues. Meanwhile, Spotlight received major improvements, enabling users to execute tasks directly within the search feature, enhancing efficiency for power users. The iPadOS multitasking system saw notable refinements, making window management more intuitive and flexible, pushing the iPad further toward a desktop-like experience.</p>
    <p>Beyond software, Apple introduced AirPods camera controls, improved PSVR2 controller support for visionOS, and boosted Podcast playback speeds to 3x. The Journal app expanded to Mac and iPad, enabling more comprehensive cross-device journaling. Apple also confirmed that macOS Tahoe will be the final major update for Intel Macs, signaling a full transition to Apple Silicon. While exciting, these announcements reflect Apple's ongoing challenges, including regulatory scrutiny and AI competition.</p>
