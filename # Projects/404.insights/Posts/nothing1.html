    <h1>Nothing’s first over-ear headphones leak ahead of July unveiling</h1>
    <img class="main-img" src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/fIA54trv6VkV0TYpWoKbqA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU0MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-03/042eff80-0673-11f0-ad7f-38a7f8a5cd3c" width="700" alt="Nothing phone">
    <p>Nothing, the UK-based tech company known for its transparent designs and mid-range Android phones, is set to unveil its first over-ear headphones, the Headphone 1, on July 1. While its first-ever product was a pair of wireless earbuds, this marks Nothing's latest expansion into audio gear. Ahead of the official launch, leaked images shared by a Nothing fan page on Instagram have given the public an early look at the headphones’ design.</p>
    <p>True to the brand's signature aesthetic, the Headphone 1 features a distinct transparent look—reportedly resembling a cassette tape fused with sleek metal. Available in black/gray and silver/white colorways, the device appears to sport three physical buttons and possibly a 3.5mm headphone jack, suggesting both wireless and wired functionality. However, it remains unclear whether this design is final.</p>
<p>Nothing’s CEO, Carl Pei, confirmed that the Headphone 1 will debut alongside the company’s new flagship smartphone, the Phone 3, at an event in London. Reviewers have already praised the Phone 3a and 3a Pro for their value and design, although their limited U.S. warranty remains a caveat. Expectations are high for the July launch, particularly given the brand’s growing reputation for unconventional yet appealing consumer tech.</p>
