<h1>Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge review: super thinness above all else</h1>
<img class="main-img" src="https://images.samsung.com/in/smartphones/galaxy-s25-edge/buy/kv_formFactor_MO.png" width="700" alt="SAMSUNG Phone">
<p>Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge is a remarkably thin and lightweight flagship phone, boasting a 5.8mm frame and a 168g weight, making it one of the slimmest smartphones available. Despite its super-thin design, the device features a 6.7-inch QHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X display, a Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, and 12GB of RAM, ensuring top-tier performance. However, the ultra-thin form factor results in trade-offs, including a smaller battery capacity, leading to shorter battery life compared to other S25 models. Additionally, while the main 200MP camera delivers excellent results, the Edge lacks a telephoto lens, limiting zoom capabilities.</p>
<p>Running on Android 15 with One UI 7, the phone incorporates Samsung and Google’s latest AI tools, such as Gemini and advanced image editing features. The Now bar and live notifications enhance multitasking, displaying ongoing activities like music playback on the lock screen. Samsung has committed to software updates until 2032, making the Edge one of the longest-supported smartphones on the market. However, its extreme thinness presents challenges, such as increased heat buildup during gaming and the necessity of two-handed usage for optimal control. The phone is best used without a case, as adding one negates the primary advantage of its slim profile.</p>
<p>While the Titanium frame and hardened glass provide durability, the Edge remains a niche device, appealing primarily to users who prioritize a sleek and lightweight design over battery life and camera versatility. At £1,099 (€1,259 / $1,099 / A$1,849), it sits between the S25+ (£999) and S25 Ultra (£1,249) in price, competing with premium alternatives like the Pixel 9 Pro XL and iPhone 16 Plus. Although it delivers a high-quality experience, users who prioritize battery longevity or telephoto photography may find better options in Samsung’s lineup or rival brands. Ultimately, the Galaxy S25 Edge is a bold design experiment that redefines smartphone aesthetics while making notable trade-offs.</p>
